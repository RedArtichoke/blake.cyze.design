      <h2>A bit about me...</h2>
      <p>
        I live in
        beautiful <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kincardine,+ON/">Kincardine, Ontario</a>.
        I love visual design and programming and learning new things :)
      </p>
      <p>
        I am in my second term of
        my first year at <a href="https://www.csd.uwo.ca/">Western University in Computer Science with a minor in design</a>.  It has been a
        challenging school year so far with Covid-19 impacting how universities deliver courses.  So far so good,
        I have proven that I am capable of working with minimal supervision remotely - both for school and work
        (my last summer job at Dairy Queen was partly remote).
      </p>
      <h2>Applications I use for design...</h2>
      <p>
        I have had an Adobe Creative Cloud subscription for over five years, and, in that time,
        I have been a regular user of Illustrator, Photoshop
        and Premiere for various school & personal projects.  Lately I have been learning <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> - it looks great
        for user interface design and collaboration.  My design class at university uses Affinity Designer and Photo.  It's
        a great low budget option, but I feel like I have been spoiled from using Photoshop and Illustrator for so long!
      </p>
      <h2>For presentations & prototyping...</h2>
      <p>
        I am at home using both PowerPoint and Keynote.  And I am completely
        comfortable with MS Office and Pages.  Or drawing on a napkin.  Whatever it takes.
      </p>
      <h2>Programming...</h2>
      <p>
        I spent last summer designing a complicated Excel spreadsheet to manage inventory at my local Dairy Queen.
        This school year I have been writing school assignments in Python and Java.  I enjoy programming
        as much as I enjoy visual design.
      </p>
      <h2>For Fun...</h2>
      <p>
        I am a big gaming nerd (at one point I was a world ranked player of
        <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/">Team Fortress 2</a>), and it was this
        passion for gaming that led me to pursue an education and career in design and computers.
      </p>
      <h2>Here are some examples of my art & design...</h2>
      <h3>Manga</h3>
      <p>
        I own an iPad Pro + Pencil, and I use
        <a href="https://procreate.art/ipad">ProCreate</a> for most of my drawings.
      </p>

      <h3>Logos & User Interface Design</h3>
      <p>
        This is a logo I designed for a hackathon app I built with some friends.  The
        application is for Alzheimer's patients who are suffering from memory loss.
        Patients can open this app and get reminders of important people in their lives,
        and other details they might forget.

      <h3>Charcoal Drawings</h3>
      <p>
        These drawings are getting a bit old now (I made them when I was 15), but
        hopefully they convey my interest in art from a young age.
      </p>

      <img src="IMG_2881.jpeg" class="mw6"/>
      <img src="IMG_2886.jpeg" class="mw6"/>
      <p>
        Ok, not charcoal... and this is REALLY early mixed-media work.  Proof I have
        been an aspiring artist since I was *very* young!
